# FIDE Chess Olympiad - Web Scraping and EDA

### Objective:
The main idea of this project was to scrape data from approximately 4,000 games played during the 2024 Chess Olympiad and store the information in a SQL Server database for later analysis and visualization.

### Files
Within the files of this repository, we can find **links.py**, which was used to collect the links that were later scraped for each game on Chess.com. On the other hand, **main.py** was used to gather the data from these links.
